### Loading the file
• Navigate into the 'Interactive_sketch_tool_del2' directory.
• Navigate into the ‘index’ directory
• Locate and open the file named ‘index.html.’ This will then load up the interactive sketch tool, granted all the above requirements are met and the installation guide was followed correctly.

### Getting familiar with the interface
* The tools found on the left-hand side of the ‘white square’ in the middle is known as the toolbar. It contains everything you need for this interface. It consists of (in order, top to bottom):
    * Undo: to revert to your previous drawing
    * Redo: to go forwards from your previous revert/undo
    * Clear all: Reset the canvas
    * The pre-set colour pallete: an assortment of easy to access colours
    * The hex colour tool: where you can select a larger array of colours
    * The eraser: to erase your mistakes
    * The pen size adjuster: to make your pen size bigger or smaller
    *  The ‘white square’ in the middle is your canvas, this is where you will make your drawings.
    * The save button is used to save whatever you have drawn on your canvas on to your local devices in a .png format.

### Operating the system

another colour from the hex colour picker.

3. Once you have selected your tool, 
a. Move your cursor over to the canvas
b. Left-click and hold down on your mouse and move your cursor.

dimensions of the canvas.
